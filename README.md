# Football Simulator

This is my football simulator program that simulates a real game with real in game decision making. This is done by creating classes and functions for each aspect of the game. The different outcomes are determined by random number generators with input probabilities reflecting real decisions coaches must make in game.

The quarterbacks for the different teams are preloaded with their completion percentage and interception percentage as baselines probabilities for wether a pass was completed, incomplete, or intercepted.

Each defensive decision is coded with varying probabilities to reflect wither the play is stopped for a minimal gain or not. For example, if you chose dime, its going to be more effective against the pass than a run. Also if you choose blitz, its going to have a higher probability of a loss of yards as well as a big play option for the offense.
